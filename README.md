## Description
An encoder-decoder deep learning model (with/without attention mechanism) where the input is an arabic sign-language video and the output is its translation in text format. 
> **Note:** For a detailed model architecture and preprocesing, refer *Video Captioning.ipynb* file.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of 
1. Total number of video samples are 534.
1. 10 different sentences performed by three signers.
2. Each video sample is already normalized to 80 frames.
> **Note:** *The link to the dataset is private and restricted to only specific personnel*.

  1. Installation
     - Download/clone this repository. Then open terminal (make sure you are in the project's directory).
     - Create a virtual environment using the command ````py -m venv yourVenvName```` and activate it using ````yourVenvName\Scripts\activate.bat````.
     - Then run the following command ````pip install -r requirements.txt````. With this, all the dependencies will be installed in your virtual environment. 
  > **Note:** *If any dependency is missing or an error shows up, install it using ````pip install moduleName````*.

  2. Usage
     1. Open your project folder and go to the terminal and activate your virtual environment. 
     2. Open the ````.ipynb```` file and enjoy.
